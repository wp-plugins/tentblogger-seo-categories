== Description ==

Improves and optimizes your <a href="http://tentblogger.com/wordpress-permalinks/" target="_blank">permalink</a> structure at the category level to make them as functional (and pretty) for both your users and the search engines (<a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>, <a href="http://bing.com" target="_blank">Bing</a>, <a href="http://yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo</a>) that index your content!

Prettier category structure for your users (increased engagement, readership).
Super light, fast, and no need for any setup.
Works with sub-categories
